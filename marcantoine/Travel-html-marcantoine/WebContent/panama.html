			<h2>The country:</h2>
			<p>There are several theories about the origin of the name
				"Panama". Some believe that the country was named after a commonly
				found species of tree (Sterculia apetala, the Panama tree). Others
				believe that the first settlers arrived in Panama in August, when
				butterflies abound, and that the name means "many butterflies" in an
				indigenous language. The best-known version is that a fishing
				village and its nearby beach bore the name "Panamá", which meant "an
				abundance of fish". Captain Antonio Tello de Guzmán, while exploring
				the Pacific side in 1515, stopped in the small indigenous fishing
				town. In 1517 Don Gaspar De Espinosa, a Spanish lieutenant, decided
				to settle a post there. In 1519 Pedrarias Dávila decided to
				establish the Empire's Pacific city in this site. The new settlement
				replaced Santa María La Antigua del Darién, which had lost its
				function within the Crown's global plan after the beginning of the
				Spanish exploitation of the riches in the Pacific. Blending all of
				the above together, Panamanians believe in general that the word
				Panama means "abundance of fish, trees and butterflies". This is the
				official definition given in social studies textbooks approved by
				the Ministry of Education in Panama. However, others believe the
				word Panama comes from the Kuna word "bannaba" which means "distant"
				or "far away".</p>
