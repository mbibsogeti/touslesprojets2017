				<h2>The Island</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Geography</strong><br> Haiti, in the West Indies,
					occupies the western third of the island of Hispaniola, which it
					shares with the Dominican Republic. About the size of Maryland,
					Haiti is two-thirds mountainous, with the rest of the country
					marked by great valleys, extensive plateaus, and lgall plains.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Government</strong><br> Republic with an elected
					government.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>History</strong><br> Explored by Columbus on Dec. 6,
					1492, Haiti's native Arawaks fell victim to Spanish rule. In 1697,
					Haiti became the French colony of Saint-Dominique, which became a
					leading sugarcane producer dependent on slaves. In 1791, an
					insurrection erupted among the slave population of 480,000,
					resulting in a declaration of independence by Pierre-Dominique
					Toussaint l'Ouverture in 1801. Napoléon Bonaparte suppressed the
					independence movement, but it eventually triumphed in 1804 under
					Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who gave the new nation the Arawak name
					Haiti . It was the world's first independent black republic.

				<h2>Port-au-prince</h2>
				<p>Port-au-Prince (/ˌpɔːrtoʊˈprɪns/; French pronunciation:
					​[pɔʁopʁɛ̃s]; Haitian Creole: Pòtoprens Haitian Creole
					pronunciation: [pɔtopɣɛ̃s]) is the capital and most populous city
					of Haiti. The city's population was estimated at 987,310 in 2015
					with the metropolitan area (aire métropolitaine) estimated at a
					population of 2,618,894.[1] The metropolitan area is defined by the
					IHSI as including the communes of Port-au-Prince,</p>

				<h2>Reaching the island</h2>
				<p>Haiti is on the western part of Hispaniola, the second
					largest island in the Greater Antilles. Haiti is the third largest
					country in the Caribbean behind Cuba and the Dominican Republic
					(the latter shares a 360-kilometre (224 mi) border with Haiti).
					Haiti at its closest point is about 45 nautical miles (83 km; 52
					mi) away from Cuba and comprises the horseshoe-shape peninsula and
					because of this, it has a disproportionately long coastline and is
					second in length (1,771 km or 1,100 mi) in the Greater Antilles.
					Cuba has the longest.[111][112] Haiti's terrain consists mainly of
					rugged mountains interspersed with lgall coastal plains and river
					valleys. The climate is tropical, with some variation depending on
					altitude. Haiti is the most mountainous nation in the Caribbean and
					its highest point is Pic la Selle, at 2,680 metres (8,793 ft).[11]
					The northern region consists of the Massif du Nord (Northern
					Massif) and the Plaine du Nord (Northern Plain). The Massif du Nord
					is an extension of the Cordillera Central in the Dominican
					Republic. It begins at Haiti's eastern border, north of the
					Guayamouc River, and extends to the northwest through the northern
					peninsula. The lowlands of the Plaine du Nord lie along the
					northern border with the Dominican Republic, between the Massif du
					Nord and the North Atlantic Ocean.</p>

					<p class="col-xs-4">After breakfast with Keight and a ride in
						her truly luxurious car, I headed home to Haiti. (You guys - Some
						people have more personal belongings and crap in their car than
						they have in their house. But her house burned down last year so
						maybe she keeps stuff in the car to keep it safe.) On these
						flights I wear a baseball hat. I keep my head down. I try not to
						talk to anyone because I am INSANE inside myself in these moments
						of leaving half my heart behind. My body language on the airplane
						must scream obscenities to everyone around me because I am truly
						just trying to deal with all my feelings. Talking to someone about
						short term missions or what they are going to go do in Haiti or
						about the lack of infrastructure ("the roads! CAN YOU BELIEVE THE
						flippin ROADS?!") in Haiti might make my head pop off and roll all
						the way down the aisle of Delta Flight 685. If someone on said
						Delta flight reads me wrong and kindly and politely asks, "What do
						you do in Haiti", I try to come up with a one word response that
						will put a stop to any potential follow up question. "Survive" is
						a trusty go-to response. It is not that I am always such a grouch
						- it is just that on transition day, I cannot do small talk.
						Cannot. Will not. Here is the deal, when I need to switch gears
						between the life and family in America and the life and family in
						Haiti, there almost always tends to be transmission or clutch
						failure. Gear shifting is not smooth on the roads of my life.</p>

					<p class="col-xs-4">I assume only robots transition without
						tears and drama, and a robot I am not. I arrive home to Port au
						Prince where Troy knows that if he is not at the airport on time I
						will probably lose my shit and cry ugly tears. Troy takes me
						immediately to a place where we can decompress and tell each other
						everything about everything we missed in two weeks of separation.
						(In this case that place is the UN base where loud helicopters and
						airplanes interrupt our conversation every ten minutes, but
						beggars cannot be choosers in this city and you get what you get.)
						On our way to the UN base I spot a huge rainbow and think, "Oh,
						look at this, Jesus is reminding me I'm probably gonna be okay." I
						ask Troy to get a photo of the rainbow but immediately I know
						Troy's photo is going to suck, so I pop my head out of the car to
						get my own rainbow photo. During the perfect capture of the
						rainbow behind the cement wall with the barbed wire on top, my
						baseball hat flies off and rolls behind us into traffic. Troy, the
						expert at stupid-Tara-things, pulls over and parks the truck so he
						can run into traffic to get my baseball hat back.I left Austin and
						landed in Atlanta where my friend Keight greeted me with wine and
						a corkscrew and put me to bed in a freezing cold room. The next
						morning she took me to have Atlanta-famous grits and some bacon.
						After breakfast with Keight and a ride in her truly luxurious car,
						I headed home to Haiti. (You guys - Some people have more personal
						belongings and crap in their car than they have in their house.
						But her house burned down last year so maybe she keeps stuff in
