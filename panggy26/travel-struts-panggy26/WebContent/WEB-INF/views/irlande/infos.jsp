	<p>Ireland, also known as the Republic of Ireland, is a sovereign state in north-western Europe occupying about five-sixths of the
		island of Ireland. The capital and largest city is Dublin, which is located on the eastern part of the island, and whose metropolitan area
		is home to around a third of the country's 4.75 million inhabitants. The state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland, a part
		of the United Kingdom. It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south, Saint George's Channel to the
		south-east, and the Irish Sea to the east. It is a unitary, parliamentary republic. The legislature, the Oireachtas, consists of a lower
		house, an upper house, and an elected President who serves as the largely ceremonial head of state, but with some important powers and
		duties. The head of government is the Taoiseach (Prime Minister, literally 'Chief', a title not used in English), who is elected by the
		DÃ¡il and appointed by the President; the Taoiseach in turn appoints other government ministers. The state was created as the Irish Free
		State in 1922 as a result of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. It had the status of dominion until 1937 when a new constitution was adopted, in
		which the state was named "Ireland" and effectively became a republic, with an elected non-executive president as head of state. It was
		officially declared a republic in 1949, following the Republic of Ireland Act 1948. Ireland became a member of the United Nations in
		December 1955. It joined the European Economic Community (EEC), the predecessor of the European Union, in 1973. The state had no formal
		relations with Northern Ireland for most of the twentieth century, but during the 1980s and 1990s the British and Irish governments worked
		with the Northern Ireland parties towards a resolution to "the Troubles". Since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, the
		Irish government and Northern Ireland Executive have co-operated on a number of policy areas under the North-South Ministerial Council
		created by the Agreement.</p>
